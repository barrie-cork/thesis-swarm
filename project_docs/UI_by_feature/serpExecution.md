# SERP Execution Feature: UX and UI Implementation Plan

## Overview

The SERP (Search Engine Results Page) Execution feature enables users to execute search queries across selected search engines via external APIs and manage the results. This implementation plan outlines a streamlined interface for configuring, executing, and monitoring search operations with clear feedback on progress and results. The design focuses on providing users with control over their search parameters while maintaining transparency about search execution status and outcomes.

## Phase 1 Implementation

### 1. SERP Execution Feature Structure

#### Pages & Screens:

* **Search Execution Dashboard:**
  * Primary interface for executing searches within a search session
  * Accessed from the Search Strategy Builder after query creation
  * Displays existing search queries with their execution status
  * Provides controls for executing new searches and monitoring progress

* **Execute Search Panel:**
  * Configuration panel for executing a search query
  * Search engine selection controls
  * Result count limitations
  * Execution parameters (date restrictions, language filters)
  * Progress indicators during execution

* **Search Results Preview Panel:**
  * Quick overview of retrieved search results
  * Summary statistics (total results, by source)
  * Execution timestamp and duration
  * Status indicators (completed, partial, failed)

* **Search Execution History Panel:**
