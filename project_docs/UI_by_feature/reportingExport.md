# Reporting & Export Feature: UX and UI Implementation Plan

## Overview

The Reporting & Export feature provides researchers with tools to generate structured reports from their systematic reviews, ensuring compliance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. This plan outlines a phased implementation approach that delivers essential reporting capabilities in Phase 1, with enhanced visualization, customization, and export options in Phase 2.

## Phase 1 Implementation

### 1. Reporting & Export Feature Structure

#### Pages & Screens:

* **Report Generation Page:**
  * Central interface for viewing and generating reports from review data of a specific session.
  * Accessed typically after a review is in progress or completed (e.g., from the Results Overview Page or, in Phase 2, from the Session Hub Page).
  * Organized into distinct sections corresponding to PRISMA flow components
  * Presents key statistics and search parameters in a structured format
  * Simple, text-based presentation optimized for copy/paste operations

* **PRISMA Flow Summary Panel:**
  * Text-based summary of key PRISMA flow metrics
  * Displays counts for each stage of the review process
  * Presents information in a structured, hierarchical format

* **Search Strategy Summary Panel:**
  * Comprehensive listing of all search parameters
  * Grouped by PIC (Population, Interest, Context) framework
  * Includes additional search parameters (limiters, domains, file types)

* **Query Execution Summary Panel:**
  * Lists all search queries executed per search engine (SERP)
  * Includes execution timestamps and result counts
  * Shows search engine-specific parameters

#### Transitions & Interactions:

* **Review Context (e.g., Results Overview Page / Session Hub Page) → Report Generation:** Direct navigation from a review session's context to the reporting interface.
* **Copy Section → Clipboard:** One-click copying of specific report sections

   * Use template pattern for different report types
   * Create a consistent data access layer for report generation

2. **Performance Considerations:**
   * Generate reports on demand rather than real-time
   * Cache report data when possible
   * Implement progressive loading for large reports
   * Optimize visualizations for performance

3. **Accessibility Compliance:**
   * Ensure all reports have proper semantic structure
   * Provide text alternatives for visualizations
   * Maintain keyboard navigability throughout
   * Test with screen readers and assistive technologies

4. **Print Optimization:**
   * Create print-friendly CSS for browser printing
   * Test printed output across different browsers
   * Ensure page breaks occur at logical points
   * Apply print-specific styling automatically

### Integration Points

   * Academic repository connections.
   * Publication platforms.
   * Institutional research databases.

3. **User Workflow Integration:**
   * Clear pathways from review completion (or in-progress state via Session Hub Page in Phase 2) to reporting.
   * Report generation as part of review lifecycle.
   * Integration with user notification system.
   * Sharing capabilities within research teams.

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to developing the Reporting & Export feature, ensuring that Phase 1 delivers essential capabilities while establishing a foundation for the more sophisticated functionality planned for Phase 2.
