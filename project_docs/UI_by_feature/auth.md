# Authentication Feature: UX and UI Implementation Plan

## Overview

The Authentication Feature establishes the entry point and identity management system for the Thesis Grey application. This implementation plan outlines a user-friendly authentication flow with clear transitions, focusing on security and usability while accommodating the role-based access controls required for collaborative research in phase 2. Wasp is leveraged through out.

## Phase 1 Implementation

### 1. Authentication Feature Structure

#### Pages & Screens:

* **Authentication Page:**
  * Single consolidated entry point with tab-based navigation
  * Login tab (default view) with username and password fields
  * Registration tab with required fields for new account creation
  * Password visibility toggle for both login and registration
  * Remember me option and forgot password link

* **Profile Update Page:**
  * Optional first-time setup for new users
  * Form for entering optional profile information
  * Option to upload a profile image
  * Field for specifying research interests and expertise

* **Password Recovery Page:**
  * Email input for password reset link
  * Confirmation screen after reset request
  * Reset password form (accessed via emailed link)
  * Success notification after password change

#### Transitions & Interactions:

* **Landing → Authentication:** Unauthenticated users directed to Authentication Page
* **Tab Toggle:** Simple switch between Login and Registration views
* **Login → Review Manager Dashboard:** Successful login directs to the main application dashboard, which is the Review Manager Dashboard.
* **Registration → Profile Update:** New users prompted to complete profile (optional)
* **Profile Update → Review Manager Dashboard:** After completion or skip, users reach the Review Manager Dashboard.
* **Authentication → Password Recovery → Authentication:** Complete reset flow returns to login

#### 4.3. Component Styling for Authentication

##### Buttons (Login, Register, Reset Password)

*   **Primary Button (e.g., "Login", "Sign Up"):**
    *   Light Mode: Teal (`#6A9CAB`) background, white text, subtle shadow. `padding: 8px 16px; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);`

    *   Active/Pressed: Dark Teal (`#4A7A89`).
    *   Disabled: Light Taupe (`#E4E0D5`) (light mode), Slate (`#5D6977`) (dark mode).
*   **Secondary/Link Buttons (e.g., "Forgot password?", "Back to login"):**
    *   Styled as links using Teal (`#6A9CAB`) for text color, with appropriate hover states (e.g., Light Teal or underline).

##### Form Controls (Username, Password, Email Inputs)

*   **Input Fields:**
    *   Light Mode: White (`#FFFFFF`) background, Light Taupe (`#CEC9BC`) border, Dark Charcoal (`#3C3F41`) text.
    *   Dark Mode: Slate (`#5D6977`) background, darker border (e.g., `#4A5662`), White (`#FFFFFF`) text.

    *   Unselected: Slate Blue-Gray (`#5D6977`) border (light mode), Light Taupe (`#CEC9BC`) border (dark mode).

##### Cards/Containers (for the form area)

*   **Standard Card styling for the form container:**
    *   Light Mode: White (`#FFFFFF`) background, subtle shadow, Light Taupe (`#CEC9BC`) border (or no border if using shadow primarily). `border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05); padding: 16px` (or more, e.g., `px-4 py-8 sm:px-10` as in existing examples).
    *   Dark Mode: Slate (`#5D6977`) background, darker shadow, darker border (e.g., `#3C3F41` or `#4A5662`). `box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);`

#### 4.4. Mode Switching Considerations

*   The authentication interface should respect system preferences for light/dark mode.
*   If applicable, a manual toggle should be accessible but not prominent in the authentication screens.
*   Transitions between modes should be smooth (e.g., `transition: colors 0.3s ease-in-out`).

#### 4.5. Responsive Behavior

*   **Desktop Presentation:** Full-width form with generous whitespace, centered on page. Max width approximately 24rem (384px) for the form itself, contained in a wider card/container.
*   **Mobile Adjustments:** Full-width with smaller horizontal margins (e.g., 16px), vertical stacking of all elements, appropriately sized touch targets (minimum 44×44px for interactive elements).
*   **Tablet/Mid-size:** Similar to desktop but with slightly reduced whitespace.

### 5. Accessibility Considerations

*   **Screen Reader Support:**
    *   Proper labeling of all form fields
    *   Error messages linked to relevant inputs via `aria-describedby`
    *   Focus management for form sequences
    *   Semantic HTML structure (e.g., proper heading hierarchy)

*   **Keyboard Navigation:**
    *   Logical tab order through form elements
    *   Skip links for bypassing navigation
    *   Clear focus indicators (beyond browser defaults)
    *   Keyboard shortcuts for common actions

*   **Visual Accessibility:**
    *   Sufficient color contrast for text and UI elements
    *   Text resizability without breaking layouts
    *   Support for screen magnification
    *   Alternative text for all images and icons

*   **Cognitive Accessibility:**
    *   Simple, clear language in instructions and errors
    *   Consistent positioning of elements across flows
    *   Progressive disclosure for complex operations
    *   Adequate timeout periods for session expiration
