# 1. Thesis Grey Overview and Core Concepts

This document covers the fundamental concepts of the Thesis Grey application, built with the Wasp framework.

## Background Information

### What is Thesis Grey

- Thesis Grey is a specialized application for managing grey literature in clinical guideline development.
- Built with Wasp, a declarative DSL that integrates React, Node.js, and Prisma.
- Follows a vertical slice architecture while leveraging Wasp's built-in capabilities.
- Focuses on providing a streamlined workflow for literature search, review, and reporting.

### Thesis Grey Project Structure

- A `main.wasp` file in the root directory defines the app's configuration, entities, routes, pages, and operations.
- The `schema.prisma` file implicitly defined through entity declarations in `main.wasp`.
- Custom code lives in feature-specific directories under `src/client/` and `src/server/`.
- Key features are organized in verticals:
  - `auth`: User authentication and profile management
  - `searchStrategy`: Building and managing search queries
  - `serpExecution`: Executing searches via external APIs
  - `resultsManager`: Processing search results
  - `reviewResults`: Tagging and annotating results
  - `reporting`: Generating statistics and exports

### The main.wasp File

- The `main.wasp` file is the central configuration file that defines the application structure.
- It contains declarations for app settings, entities, pages, routes, authentication, and operations.
- Example structure from Thesis Grey:
  ```wasp
  app ThesisGrey {
    title: "Thesis Grey",
    wasp: { version: "^0.16.0" },
    db: {
      system: PostgreSQL,
      prisma: {
        clientPreviewFeatures: ["extendedWhereUnique"]
      }
    },
    auth: {
      userEntity: User,
      methods: {
        usernameAndPassword: {}
      },
      onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
    }
  }

  // Entities, routes, pages, queries, and actions follow...
  ```

### Deployment

- Thesis Grey can be deployed to Fly.io using the Wasp deployment command.
- See the [Wasp Deployment Docs](mdc:thesis-grey/thesis-grey/https:/wasp-lang.com/docs/advanced/deployment) for details.
- For Fly.io deployment instructions, see rule `8-deployment`.
